CLAVIN-REST is the quick and dirty DropWizard RESTful micro-service for using CLAVIN (Cartographic Location And Vicinity INdexer), an award-winning open source software package for document geotagging and geoparsing that employs context-based geographic entity resolution.

CLAVIN-REST incorporates CLAVIN, GeoNames, and either OpenNLP or CLAVIN-NERD (with Stanford NER) to extract location names from unstructured text and resolve them to produce data-rich geographic entities.
