# Changelog v0.2.0

The 0.2.0 CLAVIN-REST source provides a sample REST implementation for leveraging the CLAVIN geotagger with either OpenNLP or CLAVIN-NERD (with Stanford NER), and the GeoNames gazetteer. CLAVIN-REST was created as a micro-service, using DropWizard 0.6.2 (Jersey, Jackson, Jetty, etc.), to quickly get started. CLAVIN-REST provides two endpoints: /geotag and /geotagmin. Details on these endpoints can be found in the Five Minute Tutorial.
